## Keywords
Brand, branding, brand promotion, promotional materials, visual identity

## Motivation/Problem/Opportunity
My motivation was to create a strong personal brand, thanks to which I could start offering my services such as sound healing and candles.

One of the problems was that during the thesis work my thesis supervisor got pregnant so I had not much leading, but fortunately I have very special people around me, that support me every day to be a better version of myself.

This thesis topic is a huge opportunity to grow on many levels - we can find out what we really want to do in life and what we want out of it.

## Thesis (Absctract)

For my bachelor's work I chose to create a personal brand named PatrikZen along with promotional materials, such as bussiness cards, logo, instagram profile, web, etc.
Through this brand, I will offer at least two services. The first one is sound healing. The second one is making candles.

## Approach


In the theoretical part I write about brand building and also about theory of making a good logo.

In the practical part I create the brand PatrikZen along with promotional materaials.

## Results/Outcomes/Analysis

One of the results which I have been working on is my own website: www.patrikzen.com

I also finished marketing mix 4P and the product (candles) officially started it's sale
