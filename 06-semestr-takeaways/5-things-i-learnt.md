## 5 things I learnt this semester ##

1. Words are powerful.

2. Copying (a.k.a. stealing) is not a sin and probably has been here since the beginning.

3. After this semester I started doing every-day journaling and it's an amazing way to do some self-reflection and release tension.

4. Every word has it's meaning and is important.

5. Writing is a way to express ourselves through the magic of text.
