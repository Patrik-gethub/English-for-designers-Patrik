Our lessons throughout the winter semester gave an insight of how *powerful* the typo can be. I learnt that everything is basically some kind of communication and typo
is a perfect example of that, because through typo we can translate our feelings into something physical (text,..).

Your lessons were great and I gained lots of knowledge out of them.
Your attitude towards students is great - I would say that sometimes you are even too nice to us, and it's very rare to experience this in a class scenario (elementary schools,..)
