My name is Patrik, I'm a designer and I enjoy doing what I absolutely love. Things that fit in this category are: sound healing and editing images in Photoshop.

I love design, art, and music. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, didgeridoo, piano, Tibetian bowl, and others. Music helps to heal my body, mind, and soul. My goal is to help others through music and sound healing (to let people experience the power of sound healing).
