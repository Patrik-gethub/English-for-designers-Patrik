## Copying

VI. Chapter

Copying is something I really enjoyed during since I was small. Back then, I was doing lots of experiments with copying pictures by drawing. I precisely scetched some superheroes just using a pencil and a tracing paper bought by my mother. Copying is basically part of being human and every one of us tried it (for sure).

## Writing Style

Writing style is very personal and every single person has it's own unique style. That's what is so great about it. Through writing we can freely express our inner feelings, let go of limitations and be ourselves 100%.
